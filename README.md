# Introduction
Welcome to our tutorial where we embark on a fascinating journey into the realm of data structures. In this tutorial, we'll delve into three fundamental data structures: Stack, Set, and Tree. These structures form the backbone of countless algorithms and applications, empowering us to organize, manipulate, and understand data in powerful ways.

## I. [Stack](./1-Stack.md): Building Up, One Step at a Time

Let's begin our exploration with the humble yet versatile Stack. Imagine a stack of books neatly piled on top of each other. Just like how we add and remove books from the top of the stack, a Stack data structure follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. We'll uncover real-world parallels, such as tracking your browsing history or navigating through nested function calls in programming languages.

## II. [Set](./2-Set.md): Uniting Uniqueness

Next on our agenda is the Set, a remarkable structure representing an unordered collection of unique elements. Think of it as a treasure chest where each item sparkles distinctly. We'll unlock the mathematical properties of Sets, from combining elements with Union and Intersection to crafting new collections with Difference operations. With Sets, uniqueness reigns supreme, offering unparalleled versatility in data manipulation.

## III. [Tree](./3-Tree.md): Navigating Nature's Hierarchy

Prepare to venture into the enchanting world of Trees, where hierarchical structures abound. Picture a majestic tree with branches extending in every direction. We'll unravel the terminology of Trees, from the towering Root to the interconnected Parent, Child, and Sibling nodes. Along our journey, we'll encounter Binary Trees and their specialized variant, the Binary Search Tree, mastering essential operations like traversal and search.

Throughout our tutorial, we'll not only understand the concepts but also wield practical knowledge by exploring implementations using various data structures. From arrays to linked lists and hash tables, we'll unlock the power of abstraction, enabling us to solve complex problems with elegance and efficiency.

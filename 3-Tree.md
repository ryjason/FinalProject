# 3. Tree

## Introduction:
Trees stand as majestic hierarchical structures, branching out into a myriad of possibilities. As we embark on this journey, we'll uncover the essence of trees, exploring their fundamental concepts and diverse applications.

## Definition of a Tree (Hierarchical structure with nodes):
A tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes connected by edges. At the pinnacle of this hierarchy lies the root node, branching out into various child nodes, forming a branching structure reminiscent of natural trees.

## Terminology (Root, Parent, Child, Sibling):
To navigate the intricacies of trees, it's essential to grasp key terminology:

- Root: The topmost node of the tree, serving as the entry point for traversal.
- Parent: A node that has child nodes stemming from it.
- Child: Nodes directly connected to a parent node.
- Sibling: Nodes that share the same parent node.
- Different types of Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree):

Trees come in various forms, each tailored to specific requirements. Two notable types include:

Binary Tree: A tree in which each node has at most two child nodes, commonly referred to as the left child and right child.
Binary Search Tree (BST): A specialized binary tree that adheres to a specific ordering property, where the left child of a node contains values smaller than the node's value, and the right child contains values greater than the node's value.
Binary Tree:
In the realm of binary trees, we unravel the essence of simplicity intertwined with versatility. Basic operations serve as the cornerstone of binary tree manipulation, allowing us to navigate, manipulate, and extract information seamlessly.

Basic operations:

Traversal: Traversal techniques enable us to explore the nodes of a binary tree in a systematic manner. Three fundamental traversal methods include:
Inorder: Traverse the left subtree, visit the current node, traverse the right subtree.
Preorder: Visit the current node, traverse the left subtree, traverse the right subtree.
Postorder: Traverse the left subtree, traverse the right subtree, visit the current node.
Binary Search Tree (BST):
A shining beacon of order amidst the chaos of data, the Binary Search Tree (BST) embodies precision and efficiency. Defined by its strict ordering property, the BST facilitates rapid search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Definition and properties:
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree in which the value of each node follows a specific ordering property: the value of nodes in the left subtree is less than the node's value, and the value of nodes in the right subtree is greater than the node's value.

Operations (Insertion, Deletion, Search):

Insertion: Adding a new node to the BST while maintaining the ordering property.
Deletion: Removing a node from the BST while preserving the ordering property.
Search: Locating a specific value within the BST with optimal efficiency, leveraging its ordered structure.

## Introduction:
In the world of data structures, a set stands as a cornerstone, representing an unordered collection of unique elements. As we embark on this journey, we'll unravel the essence of sets and their mathematical properties, paving the way for efficient data manipulation.

## Definition of a Set (Unordered collection of unique elements):
A set is a fundamental data structure that represents a collection of unique elements, devoid of any specific order. Each element within a set is distinct, ensuring uniqueness throughout.

## Mathematical properties of Sets:
Sets unleash a treasure trove of mathematical operations, enabling us to manipulate data with finesse:

Union: Combining two sets to form a new set containing all unique elements from both sets.
Intersection: Extracting the common elements shared between two sets, forming a new set.
Difference: Subtracting one set from another, resulting in a set containing elements present in the first set but not in the second.

## Operations:
1. Add: Inserting an element into the set, ensuring uniqueness by disregarding duplicates.
2. Remove: Deleting a specified element from the set, if it exists.
3. Contains: Verifying whether a specific element exists within the set.
4. Size: Determining the cardinality of the set, i.e., the number of elements it contains.

# 1. Stack
[Back](./README.md)

## Introduction:
A stack is a fundamental data structure that operates on the principle of Last In, First Out (LIFO). Picture a stack of plates in a cafeteria: the last plate placed onto the stack is the first one to be removed. In this section, we'll explore the definition of a stack and its real-world applications.

## Definition of a Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out):
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

## Real-world examples of stacks:
Stacks are ubiquitous in both the digital and physical worlds. Consider the Undo/Redo functionality in text editors or graphic design software. Each action performed is added to a stack, allowing users to backtrack through their history. Similarly, in programming, the call stack manages function calls during program execution, ensuring that each function call is processed in the reverse order of its invocation.

## Operations:
1. Push: Adding an element to the top of the stack.
2. Pop: Removing and returning the top element from the stack.
3. Size: Returning the number of elements currently in the stack.
4. IsEmpty: Checking if the stack is empty.
